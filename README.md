What is AnarchistsPrime?
----------------

AnarchistsPrime is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. AnarchistsPrime uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. AnarchistsPrime is also the name of the open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the AnarchistsPrime client software, see http://www.AnarchistsPrime.info
